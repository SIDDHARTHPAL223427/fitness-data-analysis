##### **Comparative Analysis of Regression Models for Health \& Fitness Prediction**



This project applies multiple machine learning regression techniques to analyze a Meal Plan \& Exercise Schedule dataset that includes gender, fitness goals, BMI, and activity details, with the objective of predicting health-related outcomes such as caloric needs, workout duration, and BMI trends. The pipeline involves data preprocessing through feature encoding, scaling, and train-test split, followed by the implementation of five regression models: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Networks using Keras/TensorFlow. Each model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score, with results visualized through comparative bar charts to highlight accuracy and generalization. Experiments revealed that while Linear and Polynomial Regression served as useful baselines, tree-based methods provided strong predictive accuracy, and the Random Forest Regressor consistently achieved the best performance. The project is built in Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and the dataset is sourced from Kaggle in Excel format. By combining classical and deep learning models, this work demonstrates how AI can provide actionable insights in the field of fitness and nutrition while showcasing practical experience in model building, evaluation, and visualization.
